# Activity: Your Own Repository
In this activity, create a GitHub repository to store a lesson plan. _Note: GitHub repositories are well-suited for storing **collections** of lesson plans, but for this activity, we'll store a single one._

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Account
[Click here to sign up for GitHub.](https://github.com/signup) Note than you _must_ verify your email to complete basic GitHub tasks like creating a repository.

## Step 2: Create a Repository
Once you've created a GitHub account and verified your email, [click here to open the Lesson Plan Template repository](https://github.com/hylandtechoutreach/lesson-plan-template). From there:

1. Click the **Use this template** button in the top right corner
1. Select the **Create a new repository** option  
    ![](Assets/CreateNewRepoFromTemplate.png)
1. Select an owner (should be you)
1. Give the repository a name under **Repository name**  
    - For example, "python-lesson"
1. Add a description under **Description**  
    - For example, "A lesson to introduce 6-8th graders to Python"
1. Click the **Create repository** button  
    ![](Assets/CreateRepository.png)

That's it - you now have your own lesson plan repository!

## Step 3: Update the Lesson Plan
The next step is to actually write out the lesson plan. For now, just change the **README.md** file so that it has the proper header and introductory blurb.

1. From the repository in GitHub, open the **README.md** file from the file list by clicking on it

1. From the file in GitHub, click the edit button in the upper right  
    ![](Assets/EditReadme.png)  
1. For now, change just the top two lines
    - The top line should say something like "Python Lesson"
    - The second line should say something like "A lesson to introduce 6-8th graders to Python"
    - _Note: this file is in markdown format_
1. When complete, click the **Commit changes...** button in the upper right  
    ![](Assets/CommitReadmeChanges.png)
1. In the pop-up that appears, update the **Commit message** field with some more information
    - Like "Update README.md with lesson title"
1. Click the **Commit changes** button  
    ![](Assets/CommitChangesPopup.png)

That's it - you've successfully committed and pushed a change to a GitHub repository!
