Participants in this session will learn to harness the power of Git to enhance their instructional design practices and share knowledge with their students. Version control is a crucial aspect of any large-scale software development project, but its potential goes far beyond the professional world. With Git and GitHub, teachers can develop platform-agnostic lesson plans, collaborate on changes, surface materials for students, and gain access to the entire ecosystem of open-source tools and assets. Not only that, but students can leverage GitHub for their own projects and gain the invaluable skills needed to contribute to enterprise-level codebases. Join this session to learn how to use Git and GitHub to prepare your students for the collaborative tech careers of the future.
